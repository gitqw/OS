Page memory allocator. Every page(4kB) is devided into blocks of the same size or is a part of a big virtual page. 
Page is devided into blocks that vary from minimal size (4 or 8 bytes, depends on architecture) to maximal, that
equals half page capacity (2kB).
If a page is devided, then it starts with specific header, which points to the first free block of memory and 
saves size of each block on a page. So, all free blocks in a page a linked together into the list. Used memory
blocks are controlled by user.
Also so-called "classes list" is created, where each node is a list of free page headers of the same size. Each time
new page is created and devided into blocks or is deleted, all changes are saved in the "classes list". This list
helps to find empty blocks of specific size faster.
